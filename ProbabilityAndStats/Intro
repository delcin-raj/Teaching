Why you need a function to approximate the data?
You are studying probability in order to understand the probability distribution
of the underlying phenonmena.

Axiom:
    Sum of probability of all events should be 1

What is probability distribution?
Here the phenonmena is tossing a coin.
underlying distribution is nothing but probability of a particular event
to occur.
H | T P(H) = P(T) = 0.5

Let's assume you have an unfair coin, such that

P(H) = 0.8  and P(T) = 0.2

Rolling a die is another phenonmena, where the underlying probability
distribution is,
P(1) = P(2) = ... = P(6) = 1/6

So what happens when you are attempting to study an event which is 
happening in the real world? For example let's take preidcting the weahter.
Humans are much interested in knowing weather as it affects their life 
greatly. But atmosphere is a complex system, meaning many factors affect
its behaviour. For example the Sun, the moon, the ocean currents, the wind,
the composition of air, humidity of that local area, and so on....

So it is not possible to measure all the affecting variables in the first 
place. Meaning let's asssume that you are trying to study weather. Is it 
possible for you to know all the affecting variables in the first place?
If the answer is no what will you do?

You approach probability and statistics for help because
for a given measurement there can be potentially many outcomes.

f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2
Let's say you don't know the function but you want to study it.
You can make measurement of the function and you can measure x but
you can't measure y.
f(1) = 1, f(1) = 5, f(1) = 1, f(1) = It can be any positive number >= 1

So what is the point of studying some phenonmena for which the underlying
variables are unknown and you have the ability to measure some of the
affecting variables. And you are interested in preidcting the outcome 
of the phenonmena. 

Example you are trying to study the relationship between temperature 
and rainfall. You have collected some data.

1) T = 30, R = False
2) T = 29, R = False
3) T = 35, R = True 
4) T = 30, R = True
5) T = 30, R = False

3 datapoints have T = 30, 1),4),5)
P(Rain to occur | T = 30) = 1/3

Probability is the field of study which works based on some assumptions 
about the underlying probability distribution.

Statistics is the field of study in which you try to find a probability
distribution (which is theoretical) which best describes the data.

Newton studied extensively the astronomical data that was collected by
Kepler and he came up with a function which best describes gravity as 
a functioni distance between two objects. 

H -> 0
T -> 1
P(0) = 0.5 = P(1)
P(x) = 0 for all x other than 0 and 1
Discrete Probability:
Axiom: sum of probability of all events should be 1.

Continuous Probability:
Axiom: Integral of probability of all events should be 1.

Omega is the phenonmena basically it represents the set of all 
events. 
So what is an event? It is the subset of the possible occurences.
Examples.
In Coin flipping
{H},{T}, {}, {H,T}, P({H,T}) = 1, P({}) = 0

In rolling dies,
{1,2,3} {4,5,6}, {1} , {3,4},... like this you have 2^6 events.
P({1,2,3}) = 0.5, P({1,2,3,4,5}) = 5/6

P((3,4)) = P([3,4])
P([3,4])
